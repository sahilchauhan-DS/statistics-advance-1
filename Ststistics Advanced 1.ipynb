What is a random variable in probability theory?\n","\n","A random variable is a numerical value determined by the outcome of a random experiment.\n","a. It assigns numbers to outcomes in a sample space.\n","\n","2. What are the types of random variables?\n","\n","a. Discrete random variables – take on countable values (e.g., number of heads in a coin toss).\n","\n","b. Continuous random variables – take on any value within a continuous range (e.g., height, time).\n","\n","3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n","\n","a. Discrete distributions involve variables with distinct, countable values.\n","\n","b. Continuous distributions involve variables with outcomes across an unbroken range.\n","\n","4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n","\n","a. A PDF describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking a particular value.\n","\n","b. The area under the curve of a PDF over an interval represents the probability of values falling within that range.\n","\n","5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n","\n","a. A PDF shows probability density at a specific point (for continuous variables).\n","\n","b. A CDF shows the total probability that a variable is less than or equal to a given value.\n","\n","c. The CDF is derived by integrating the PDF.\n","\n","6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n","\n","a. It assigns equal probability to all values in a finite set.\n","\n","b. Example: In a fair die roll, each outcome (1 to 6) has a probability of 1/6.\n","\n","7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n","\n","a. Only two outcomes: 0 (failure) and 1 (success).\n","\n","b. Defined by a single parameter\n","𝑝\n","p, the probability of success.\n","\n","c. Mean =\n","𝑝\n","p, Variance =\n","𝑝\n","(\n","1\n","−\n","𝑝\n",")\n","p(1−p).\n","\n","8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n","\n","a. It models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n","\n","b. Used when each trial has the same probability of success.\n","\n","c. Defined by two parameters:\n","𝑛\n","n (number of trials) and\n","𝑝\n","p (success probability).\n","\n","9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n","\n","a. It models the number of events in a fixed time or space interval.\n","\n","b. Assumes events occur independently at a constant rate.\n","\n","c. Common applications: phone call arrivals, email traffic, or defects in a product.\n","\n","10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n","\n","a. Every value within a specified interval is equally likely.\n","\n","b. The PDF is constant over the interval.\n","\n","c. Example: Random number generation between 0 and 1.\n","\n","11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n","\n","a. Symmetrical and bell-shaped curve.\n","\n","b. Mean = median = mode.\n","\n","c. Defined by mean\n","𝜇\n","μ and standard deviation\n","𝜎\n","σ.\n","\n","d. The total area under the curve equals 1.\n","\n","12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n","\n","a. It is a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n","\n","b. Used to calculate probabilities and Z-scores.\n","\n","c. Allows comparison across different normal distributions.\n","\n","13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n","\n","a. It states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal as sample size increases.\n","\n","b. It enables inference using the normal distribution, even for non-normal populations.\n","\n","c. Essential for constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests.\n","\n","14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n","\n","a. The CLT justifies the use of the normal distribution for sample means.\n","\n","b. Even if the population is not normal, the sample mean will be approximately normal if the sample size is large enough.\n","\n","15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n","\n","a. Z statistics measure how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.\n","\n","b. Used to test hypotheses about population parameters (like means or proportions) when the standard deviation is known.\n","\n","c. Helps determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n","\n","16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n","\n","a. Formula:\n","𝑍\n","=\n","𝑋\n","−\n","𝜇\n","𝜎\n","Z=\n","σ\n","X−μ\n","​\n","\n","\n","b. It represents how far a value\n","𝑋\n","X is from the mean\n","𝜇\n","μ in terms of standard deviations.\n","\n","c. Used to standardize values and compare them across distributions.\n","\n","17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?\n","\n","a. Point estimate – A single value used to estimate a population parameter (e.g., sample mean).\n","\n","b. Interval estimate – A range of values (like a confidence interval) that likely contains the true parameter.\n","\n","18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n","\n","a. Confidence intervals show the range within which a population parameter likely falls.\n","\n","b. They reflect uncertainty in the estimate and provide more information than a point estimate.\n","\n","c. A 95% confidence level means that 95 out of 100 intervals would contain the true parameter.\n","\n","19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?\n","\n","a. Z-scores define the boundaries of confidence intervals under a normal distribution.\n","\n","b. For a 95% confidence level, the critical Z-score is approximately ±1.96.\n","\n","c. These values help calculate the margin of error.\n","\n","20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n","\n","a. Z-scores standardize values across distributions with different means and standard deviations.\n","\n","b. This allows for meaningful comparisons of scores from different datasets.\n","\n","21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n","\n","a. Samples must be independent.\n","\n","b. Sample size should be sufficiently large (typically\n","𝑛\n","≥\n","30\n","n≥30).\n","\n","c. Data must come from the same distribution (identically distributed).\n","\n","d. Population must have finite variance.\n","\n","22. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n","\n","a. The expected value is the average outcome if an experiment is repeated many times.\n","\n","b. For discrete variables:\n","𝐸\n","[\n","𝑋\n","]\n","=\n","∑\n","𝑥\n","𝑖\n","𝑃\n","(\n","𝑥\n","𝑖\n",")\n","E[X]=∑x\n","i\n","​\n"," P(x\n","i\n","​\n"," ).\n","\n","c. For continuous variables:\n","𝐸\n","[\n","𝑋\n","]\n","=\n","∫\n","𝑥\n","𝑓\n","(\n","𝑥\n",")\n","𝑑\n","𝑥\n","E[X]=∫xf(x)dx.\n","\n","23. How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n","\n","a. The probability distribution provides the likelihood of each possible outcome.\n","\n","b. The expected value is calculated using the distribution by summing (or integrating) each value times its probability.\n","\n","c. It represents the long-run average result of repeated trials."],"metadata":{"id":"-m9gpCUk23LC"}}]}
